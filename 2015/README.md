# 2015 AoC Solutions

Just a landing place for my AoC 2015 solutions. Worth mentioning I started doing this in 2024, and it uses some Python syntax that requires at least Python 3.10 (`match/case`)

I'll try to go back and fill these older years out as I have time.

Oh, one last thing. The file paths are relative to the 2015 directory. I switched it over to use the advent-of-code root when I started 2024.
